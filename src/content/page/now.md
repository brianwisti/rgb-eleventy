Last year we moved to [Federal Way][], a suburb between Seattle and Tacoma.
After twenty years in the city, I'm still adjusting to back yards and no coffee shop across the street.
Work is writing [Python][] — mostly [Django][] — for [Nokia][].
Don't need to stay inside so much because of that yard, but I'm keeping a close eye on the COVID
vaccination rates before I spend much time around other people.

Not that I ever did spend much time around other people.

* as I'm writing this we're kinda snowed in; it's pretty but I'm ready for it to go away
* just [ported][] this site to [Eleventy][]
* but that'll probably just be a gateway drug to other [Jamstack][] frameworks
* we got cats, but if you follow me on Twitter you probably already know this
* cleaning up the site to get it where I can more easily try building it with
  different [Jamstack](https://jamstack.com) frameworks.
* Working. A lot. Which is better than some of the alternatives, but still. At least it's a fun
  project.
* Been [married][] almost two years!
