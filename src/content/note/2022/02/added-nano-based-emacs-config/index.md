A *lot* of fiddling with Emacs today. Thought I'd try something not so much
"vanilla" as on fewer predetermined rails than the average [Doom
Emacs][doom-emacs] config.

This new [config][] starts from [nano-emacs][], a rather streamlined setup. Of
*course* I enjoyed cluttering it up.

[config]: /config/emacs/nano
