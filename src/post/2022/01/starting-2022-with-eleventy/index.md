Finally ported enough of my site to [Eleventy][] that I feel like making it
live. It's only been two and a half years since I started [thinking][] about
this. Why rush into things, right?

## But why?

Well, Eleventy's got [Nunjucks][] support, for starters. For the Pythonistas
out there, Nunjucks is basically [Jinja][] for Node.js.

[Jinja]: https://jinja2docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

Beyond that, the Node.js ecosystem is pretty lively, with plenty to keep the
dedicated [putterer][] occupied for a bit. Eleventy can hook into enough of
that without going overboard on the [Jamstack][] application side of things. A
gentle transition.

## Can I see?

Sure! I shared pretty much everything — all the logic, at least — on a [Github repo][].

## This isn't even my final form

Nowhere near what I'd call "done." There's still things to touch up with the
Eleventy site. Layout, workflow, architecture.

And naturally I'm already casting glances at other SSGs like [Lume][]. I
haven't abandoned the [Astro][] experiment either. I'm just waiting for Astro
to be a little quicker at assembling a site like mine.

I just really really wanted to stop complaining about [Hugo][]. It's great. It
really is. It just hasn't felt like a good fit for my particular flow in the
last couple years.
