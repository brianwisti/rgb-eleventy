Would you look at that? We got some actual weather.

What else?

[Astro]: https://astro.build
[repo]: https://github.com/brianwisti/rgb-eleventy

Been keeping myself busy with the JavaScript static site generators.
Last week's [Astro][] experiment got slow so I've been messing with [Eleventy][].
There's a [repo][] mirrored to Github if you want to see the carnage.

Probably my last note of the year, so: Happy New Year!
