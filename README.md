# rgb-eleventy

Just the latest attempt at building my site with Eleventy.

## What I'm using and why

A reminder for when I'm staring at `package.json` in the middle of the night.

`@11ty/eleventy`
: the SSG itself

`luxon`
: for tighter control of date formatting in my `<time />` elements

`sass`
: CSS style management

`onchange`
: so I don't have to rebuild styles myself

`npm-run-all`
: so can build styles and site pages at the same time

`browser-sync`
: so I don't need to manually refresh the browser during dev

## Resources
